# My App

1. Develop a small react native application that is similar to the figma design provided.
2. Integrate firebase authentication and firebase database to your app. The "Sign Up" and "Sign In" processes should be there.
3. Once a user has successfully signed in, the user should persist across the application, meaning that repeated logins should not be there.
4. Using GOT Api, your app should be able to list the characters. You are free to come up with a design for this screen.
5. Profile screen should have user information. If a user chooses to log out, the user should be redirected to the "Sign In" screen.
